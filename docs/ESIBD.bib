The resulting ground and excited molecular conformations, adsorbed on the surface, are imaged at the single-molecule level. This technique permits the exploration of oligosaccharide conformations, until now, limited by the high flexibility of oligosaccharides and ensemble-averaged analytical methods. As a model for cellulose, cellohexaose chains are observed in two conformational extremes, the typical ``extended'' chain and the atypical ``coiled'' chain\textemdash the latter identified as the gas-phase conformer preserved on the surface. Observing conformations between these two extremes reveals the physical properties of cellohexaose, behaving as a rigid ribbon that becomes flexible when twisted. The conformation space of any molecule that can be electrosprayed can now be explored.},

This approach allows information on the homogeneity, stoichiometry, shape, and interactions of native protein complexes to be obtained, complementary to high-resolution protein structures. We have recently demonstrated TEM sample preparation via native electrospray ion-beam deposition (ES-IBD) as a direct link between native MS and cryo-EM. This workflow forms a potential new route to the reliable preparation of homogeneous cryo-EM samples and a better understanding of the relation between native solution-phase and native-like gas-phase structures. However, many aspects of the workflow need to be understood and optimized to obtain performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art cryo-EM. Here, we expand on the previous discussion of key factors by probing the effects of substrate type and deposition energy. We present and discuss micrographs from native ES-IBD samples with amorphous carbon, graphene, and graphene oxide, as well as landing energies in the range between 2 and 150 eV per charge.},

Here we present native electrospray ion-beam deposition (native ES-IBD) for the preparation of extremely high-purity cryo-EM samples, based on mass selection in vacuum. Folded protein ions are generated by native electrospray ionization, mass-filtered, and gently deposited on cryo-EM grids, and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. We demonstrate homogeneous coverage of ice-free cryo-EM grids with mass-selected proteins and protein assemblies. SPA reveals that they remain structurally intact, but variations in secondary and tertiary structure are currently limiting information in 2D classes and 3D EM density maps. Our results show the potential of native ES-IBD to increase the scope and throughput of cryo-EM structure determination.},

It brings molecules gently into the gas phase, where they can be accurately manipulated and purified, followed by controlled deposition onto various substrates. In combination with imaging techniques, direct structural information on well-defined molecules can be obtained, which is essential to test and interpret results from indirect mass spectrometry techniques. To date, ion-beam deposition experiments are limited to a small number of custom instruments worldwide, and there are no commercial alternatives. Here we present a module that adds ion-beam deposition capabilities to a popular commercial MS platform (Thermo Scientific Q Exactive UHMR mass spectrometer). This combination significantly reduces the overhead associated with custom instruments, while benefiting from established high performance and reliability. We present current performance characteristics including beam intensity, landing-energy control, and deposition spot size for a broad range of molecules. In combination with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we distinguish near-native from unfolded proteins and show retention of the native shape of protein assemblies after dehydration and deposition. Further, we use an enzymatic assay to quantify the activity of a noncovalent protein complex after deposition on a dry surface. Together, these results not only indicate a great potential of ES-IBD for applications in structural biology, but also outline the challenges that need to be solved for it to reach its full potential.},

  abstract = {Soft- and reactive landing of mass-selected ions is gaining attention as a promising approach for the precisely-controlled preparation of materials on surfaces that are not amenable to deposition using conventional methods. A broad range of ionization sources and mass filters are available that make ion soft-landing a versatile tool for surface modification using beams of hyperthermal ({$<$}100 eV) ions. The ability to select the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion, its kinetic energy and charge state, along with precise control of the size, shape, and position of the ion beam on the deposition target distinguishes ion soft landing from other surface modification techniques. Soft- and reactive landing have been used to prepare interfaces for practical applications as well as precisely-defined model surfaces for fundamental investigations in chemistry, physics, and materials science. For instance, soft- and reactive landing have been applied to study the surface chemistry of ions isolated in the gas-phase, prepare arrays of proteins for high-throughput biological screening, produce novel carbon-based and polymer materials, enrich the secondary structure of peptides and the chirality of organic molecules, immobilize electrochemically-active proteins and organometallics on electrodes, create thin films of complex molecules, and immobilize catalytically active organometallics as well as ligated metal clusters. In addition, soft landing has enabled investigation of the size-dependent behavior of bare metal clusters in the critical subnanometer size regime where chemical and physical properties do not scale predictably with size. The morphology, aggregation, and immobilization of larger bare metal nanoparticles, which are directly relevant to the design of catalysts as well as improved memory and electronic devices, have also been studied using ion soft landing. This review article begins in section 1 with a brief introduction to the existing applications of ion soft- and reactive landing. Section 2 provides an overview of the ionization sources and mass filters that have been used to date for soft landing of mass-selected ions. A discussion of the competing processes that occur during ion deposition as well as the types of ions and surfaces that have been investigated follows in section 3. Section 4 discusses the physical phenomena that occur during and after ion soft landing, including retention and reduction of ionic charge along with factors that impact the efficiency of ion deposition. The influence of soft landing on the secondary structure and biological activity of complex ions is addressed in section 5. Lastly, an overview of the structure and mobility as well as the catalytic, optical, magnetic, and redox properties of bare ionic clusters and nanoparticles deposited onto surfaces is presented in section 6. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Imaging of proteins at the single-molecule level can reveal conformational variability, which is essential for the understanding of biomolecules. To this end, a biologically relevant state of the sample must be retained during both sample preparation and imaging. Native electrospray ionization (ESI) can transfer even the largest protein complexes into the gas phase while preserving their stoichiometry and overall shape. High-resolution imaging of protein structures following native ESI is thus of fundamental interest for establishing the relation between gas phase and solution structure. Taking advantage of low-energy electron holography's (LEEH) unique capability of imaging individual proteins with subnanometer resolution, we investigate the conformational flexibility of Herceptin, a monoclonal IgG antibody, deposited by native electrospray mass-selected ion beam deposition (ES-IBD) on graphene. Images reconstructed from holograms reveal a large variety of conformers. Some of these conformations can be mapped to the crystallographic structure of IgG, while others suggest that a compact, gas-phase\textendash related conformation, adopted by the molecules during ES-IBD, is retained. We can steer the ratio of those two types of conformations by changing the landing energy of the protein on the single-layer graphene surface. Overall, we show that LEEH can elucidate the conformational heterogeneity of inherently flexible proteins, exemplified here by IgG antibodies, and thereby distinguish gas-phase collapse from rearrangement on surfaces.},

Photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) are employed in order to characterize the sample with respect to coverage, homogeneity, and the fraction of intact landed ions (soft-landing ratio). We find that homogeneous rhodamine films of defined composition can be produced at energies of 2?100 eV. The coverage is found to be proportional to the ion dose. Soft-landing is observed for energies up to 35 eV.},

  abstract = {Measuring and understanding the complexity that arises when nanostructures interact with their environment are one of the major current challenges of nanoscale science and technology. High-resolution microscopy methods such as scanning probe microscopy have the capacity to investigate nanoscale systems with ultimate precision, for which, however, atomic scale precise preparation methods of surface science are a necessity. Preparative mass spectrometry (pMS), defined as the controlled deposition of m/z filtered ion beams, with soft ionization sources links the world of large, biological molecules and surface science, enabling atomic scale chemical control of molecular deposition in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). Here we explore the application of high-resolution scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to the characterization of structure and properties of large molecules. We introduce the fundamental principles of the combined experiments electrospray ion beam deposition and scanning tunneling microscopy. Examples for the deposition and investigation of single particles, for layer and film growth, and for the investigation of electronic properties of individual nonvolatile molecules show that state-of-the-art pMS technology provides a platform analog to thermal evaporation in conventional molecular beam epitaxy. Additionally, it offers additional, unique features due to the use of charged polyatomic particles. This new field is an enormous sandbox for novel molecular materials research and demands the development of advanced molecular ion beam technology.},

  abstract = {The physical and chemical properties of macromolecules like proteins are strongly dependent on their conformation. The degrees of freedom of their chemical bonds generate a huge conformational space, of which, however, only a small fraction is accessible in thermal equilibrium. Here we show that soft-landing electrospray ion beam deposition (ES-IBD) of unfolded proteins allows to control their conformation. The dynamics and result of the deposition process can be actively steered by selecting the molecular ion beam's charge state or tuning the incident energy. Using these parameters, protein conformations ranging from fully extended to completely compact can be prepared selectively on a surface, as evidenced on the subnanometer/amino acid resolution level by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, our results demonstrate that the final conformation on the surface is reached through a mechanical deformation during the hyperthermal ion surface collision. Our experimental results independently confirm the findings of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) studies of protein gas phase conformations. Moreover, we establish a new route for the processing of macromolecular materials, with the potential to reach conformations that would be inaccessible otherwise.},

  abstract = {Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRTEM) has enabled atomically resolved imaging of molecules adsorbed on low-dimensional materials like carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide and few-layer-graphene. However, conventional methods for depositing molecules onto such supports lack selectivity and specificity. Here, we describe the chemically selective preparation and deposition of molecules-like polyoxometalate (POM) anions [PW12O40]3- using electrospray ion-beam deposition (ES-IBD) along with high-resolution TEM imaging. This approach provides access to sub-monolayer coatings of intact molecules on freestanding graphene, which enables their atomically resolved ex situ characterization by low-voltage AC-HRTEM. The capability to tune the deposition parameters in either soft or reactive landing mode, combined with the well-defined high-vacuum deposition conditions, renders the ES-IBD based method advantageous over alternative methods such as drop-casting. Furthermore, it might be expanded towards depositing and imaging large and nonvolatile molecules with complex structures.},

Here, we study the structure of low-dimensional adsorbates of cesium iodide (CsI) on free-standing graphene using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy at atomic resolution. CsI is deposited onto graphene as charged clusters by electrospray ion-beam deposition. The interaction with the electron beam forms two-dimensional CsI crystals only on bilayer graphene, while CsI clusters consisting of 4, 6, 7, and 8 ions are exclusively observed on single-layer graphene. Chemical characterization by electron energy-loss spectroscopy imaging and precise structural measurements evidence the possible influence of charge transfer on the structure formation of the CsI clusters and layers, leading to different distances of the Cs and I to the graphene.},

The inherent glycan complexity and backbone flexibility require single-molecule approaches for real-space imaging. At present, glycan characterization often relies on a combination of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to provide insights into size, sequence, branching and connectivity, and therefore requires structure reconstruction from indirect information7\textendash 9. Here we show direct imaging of single glycan molecules that are isolated by mass-selective, soft-landing electrospray ion beam deposition and imaged by low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy10. The sub-nanometre resolution of the technique enables the visualization of glycan connectivity and discrimination between regioisomers.
