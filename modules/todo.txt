- git tutorial -> link to repository

stuttgart specific:
- test and debug start sampling without initialization -> no device ready, cant start acquisition
- fix ini filter to allow load files!! -> works in oxford -> test new filter

low priority
- remove empty tooltips everywhere! -> MWE (only from designer?) stackoverflow
- navigationToolbar pdf as default format
- merge svg -> webengineview -> scaling
- make manual
- play sound when signal drops below threshold
- monitor deposition with remote client
- add sample / solution manager -> save with metadata / associate with session
- too small controls on high DPI
